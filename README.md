What's Gear2Net (G2N)
===

The Gear2Net is Open Source Framework. 

It can provide the control function of the mobile and for the communication function with extern servers support for Gear2 App without development Android App.If necessary to control of the Android devices and to communicate with external servers, you must develop not only the Gear2 App but also the Android App. To get rid of such inconvenience that was mentioned earlier, developed a attractive Android App called 'Bridge App'. And provide Gear2Net API to developed of Javascript language. Also you can use this easily through provided Gear2Net API Reference.

The committer can easily present to the additional API because the Gear2Net was distinguished between Framework and API. And technical support documents about addition to API are due to be provided shortly.
